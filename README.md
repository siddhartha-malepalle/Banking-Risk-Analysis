📊 Banking Analysis Dashboard
📝 Project Overview
This project involves the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize key banking performance metrics. The dashboard provides actionable insights into loan distribution, deposit trends, and client demographics.

By incorporating filters for gender, join year, and account types, the dashboard empowers stakeholders to explore data in depth and make data-driven decisions.

Key Highlights:

Analysis of total loans and total deposits.

Segmentation by customer demographics (e.g., gender, joining year).

Separate views for Loan Analysis, Deposit Analysis, and Summary.

Metrics on checking accounts, savings accounts, and business lending.

User-friendly slicers and filters for dynamic exploration.

💡 Features
Loan Analysis Page: Visualizes loan amounts by category, year, and customer group.

Deposit Analysis Page: Tracks deposits by account type and customer segments.

Summary Page: Displays overall KPIs such as total clients, loans, and deposits.

Interactive Filters: Allows dynamic selection for demographic and time-based insights.
